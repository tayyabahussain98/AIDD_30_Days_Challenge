    ⏱ Time: 1 Hour | Marks: 10 | Deadline: 48 Hours
    📅 Class Slot: Friday — 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM
    Instructor: Sir Hamzah Syed

# 📚 Study Material

 The following concepts and resources, taken from this book (ai-native
panaversity.org), cover the material needed for this task.

### Resources
<li> Part 1 — Chapter 2: The AI Turning Point
<li> Part 1 — Chapter 4: The Nine Pillars of AI-Driven Development
 
## Key Concepts to Understand
 
### Concept
1. 3-Layer Architecture
 
        Modular stack (Models → IDEs → Agents) separating
        intelligence, workspace, and orchestration

2. Vibe Coding
 
        Coding without planning/specs — developer “vibes” into the
        code relying on intuition

3. Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

        Writing clear, executable specifications before implementation — formalizing human intent

4. The Nine Pillars 

        Integrated system (TDD, AI CLI, MCP, agents, specs, etc.) allowing a single developer to function like an entire team

5. M-Shaped Developer

         Developer with deep expertise in 2–4 complementary domains — enabled by AI bridging knowledge gaps

6. Development Agents

         Autonomous Layer-3 tools (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, etc.) executing multi-step tasks from high-level instructions

# 📁 Part A — Theory (Short Questions)
 Answer in your own wording

## 1️⃣ Nine Pillars Understanding
<li> Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup
 tasks better for your growth as a system architect?
 
### Answer:

 AI Development Agents handle repetitive tasks automatically, saving time and
 reducing errors. This allows me to focus on planning, reasoning, and designing
 the system architecture. By letting AI manage routine work, I can think at a
 higher level and grow from a code writer into a system-level developer.
 
<li> Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer.
 
### Answer:

 The Nine Pillars integrate tools like TDD, SDD, AI CLI, agents, and specifications
 into a single workflow. Using them, a developer can learn multiple skills
 simultaneously testing, planning, AI orchestration, and evaluation which builds deep expertise in several domains, helping me become an M-Shaped Developer.
 
## 2️⃣ Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
<li> Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

### Answer:

 Vibe Coding relies on intuition and quick coding without planning or
 specifications. Initially, it may work, but after some days, the code becomes hard to maintain, scale, or debug. Problems appear because the system lacks structure and clarity.

<li> How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

### Answer:

 Specification-Driven Development (SDD) ensures that clear, executable
 requirements are written before coding. AI and developers follow these
 specifications, which reduces errors, improves maintainability, and ensures the code is organized and scalable from the start.

 ## 3️⃣ Architecture Thinking
<li> How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

### Answer:

 Architecture-first thinking makes the developer focus on designing systems
 and layers instead of writing raw code. The role shifts from coding everything manually to planning workflows, orchestrating AI agents, and ensuring the system functions efficiently.

<li> Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.

### Answer:

 Thinking in layers, like the 3-Layer Architecture (Models → IDEs → Agents),
 ensures scalability, maintainability, and clear responsibilities. Developers
 become system-level thinkers who guide AI to execute tasks, rather than just
 typing lines of code. This mindset is essential to become an M-Shaped
 Developer.

# 📁 Part B — Practical Task (Screenshot Required)
### Task:

    Using any AI CLI tool, generate a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function.
 
### Requirements:
    Must contain “@”
    Must contain a valid domain (e.g., .com, .org)
    Should return clear error messages
 
### Submission:
    Your exact CLI prompt (text or screenshot)
    The 1-paragraph specification generated by the CLI

# 📱 Screenshots
 
### Prompt:

```
bash

> Write a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function. The specification must include: 1) Email must contain '@', 2) Must have a valid domain like .com or .org, 3) Return clear and descriptive error messages for invalid inputs.
```
 
### Output:

```
bash

The email validation function will verify if a given string is a valid email address. It must ensure the email contains a single '@' symbol separating the local part from the domain. Furthermore, the domain must be well-formed, including a top-level domain (TLD) such as '.com', '.org', '.net', or other recognized TLDs, preceded by at least one subdomain part. For any invalid input, the function will return a clear and descriptive error message indicating the specific reason for failure, such as "Email must contain an '@' symbol", "Invalid domain format", or "Missing top-level domain".
```

# 📁 Part C — Multiple Choice Questions

 1: What is the main purpose of Spec-Driven Development?
 
 A. Make coding faster
 
 B. Clear requirements before coding begins

 2: What is the biggest mindset shift in AI-Driven Development?
 
 A. Writing more code manually
 
 B. Thinking in systems and clear instructions

### Answer
     ✅ B. Thinking in systems and clear instructions

 3: Biggest failure of Vibe Coding?

 4: Main advantage of using AI CLI agents (like Gemini CLI)?

 A. They replace the developer completely

 B. Handle repetitive tasks so dev focuses on design & problem-solving

 C. Make coding faster but less reliable

 D. Make coding optional

### Answer
     ✅ B. Handle repetitive tasks so dev focuses on design & problem-solving

5: What defines an M-Shaped Developer?

 A. Knows little about everything

 B. Deep in only one field

 C. Deep skills in multiple related domains

# 🌟Reflection
 This task highlights how rapidly the developer role is evolving in the AI-Native era. Concepts like the Nine Pillars, SDD, and Development Agents are not just tools—they represent a complete shift in how software is planned, built, and maintained.

 By practicing architecture-first thinking and learning to collaborate with agents, developers can grow from code writers into system-level thinkers, eventually becoming M-Shaped professionals who combine multiple deep skills with intelligent tooling.
