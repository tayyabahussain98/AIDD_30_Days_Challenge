# 🚀🚀 Practical Task — Build the Study Notes Summarizer & Quiz Generator Agent

 After Context7 is connected, you will create an agent using:

 ● **OpenAgents SDK**
 
 ● **Streamlit** (recommended for UI, but HTML/CSS is allowed your choice)
 
 ● **PyPDF** (for PDF text extraction)
 
 ● **Gemini CLI**
 
 ● **Context7 MCP** (tool provider)

 ## **What the Agent Will Do**
 
 ### A. PDF Summarizer
 ● User uploads a PDF.
 
 ● Text is extracted using PyPDF.
 
 ● Agent generates a clean, meaningful summary.
 
 ● Summary can appear in any UI style students choose (card, block, container, etc.).
 
 ### B. Quiz Generator
 ● After summarization, the user can click **Create Quiz**.
 
 ● The agent reads the **original PDF** (not the summary).
 
 ● It generates:
 
 ○ MCQs
 
 ○ Or mixed-style quizzes
